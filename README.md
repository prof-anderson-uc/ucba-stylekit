# UCBA Stylekit

UCBA Stylekit is a simple, beginner-friendly CSS toolbox created for students in Web Design 1 at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College.

It provides ready-to-use class-based styles that help you create visually appealing, responsive websites ‚Äî without needing to learn a full CSS framework like Bootstrap.

- Spacing utilities (margin/padding)
- Buttons (default, primary, secondary, outline)
- Cards and image helpers
- List groups

- Utility classes (readable content, screen reader only)
- Effects (hover zoom, fade-in, highlight)

## üß† Why Use This Toolkit?

Students often struggle with naming, layout, and responsive behavior. This toolkit helps:

- Get consistent results across assignments
- Learn reusable naming patterns
- Build pages faster
- Understand utility classes before moving to full frameworks

## üß± How It‚Äôs Like a Framework (But Smaller)
This works like a **lightweight framework**:

- Uses class names to apply styles
- Encourages consistent, reusable design
- Has documentation and examples

But it‚Äôs much **simpler**:

- All styles are visible in one file
- You can read and modify the CSS
- Designed for **learning**, not production
